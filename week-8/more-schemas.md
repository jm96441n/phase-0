Release 2:

![one-to-one](/week-8/one_to_one.png)

The relationship is one-to-one, because there is only one order per customer and only one customer per order. Though many customers could have the same order, it is better to keep them separated.

REFLECTION:
1/2) What is a one-to-one database? When would you use a one-to-one database?
A one-to-one database is a database where an item in one table only have one corresponding matching item in another table. You would use one-to-one databases when you are pairing customers names and addresses, or something along those lines.
3/4) What is a many-to-many database? When would you use a many-to-many database?
A many-to-many database is a database where items in one table can correspond to a few different items in another table and vice versa. You would use a many-to-many database when you are pairing customers names with products they ordered. One person could order many products, and one product could be ordered by many people.
5) What is confusing about database schemas? What makes sense?
Implementing one-to-one database schemas is what I find confusing, not necessarily the concept, but implementing or making one. The rest of the information about schema's makes sense.
