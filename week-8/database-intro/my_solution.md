1) What are databases for?
Databases are for storing information. They normally store the information in 
tables, with rows and columns, which make searching through the data much more 
efficient.

2) What is a one-to-many relationship?
A one-to-many relationship is one where a single object contains multiple others 
that are related to it. For an example you can think of a gaming system and it's 
game, the one is the gaming system (the games can only be played on the gaming 
system, no other type) and the many are the games (the gaming system can play many 
different games).

3) What is a primary key? What is a foreign key? How can you determine which is which?
A primary key is a key that is in the table that it is referring to, a foreign key is 
a key that is stored in another table.

4) How can you select information out of a SQL database? What are some general guidelines 
for that?
You can select information out a SQL database in many different ways, you can select 
information based on the column name, the row, you can sort by what information are in 
each row or column, really in any way you think of.
