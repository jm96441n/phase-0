# 1.1 Think About Time Reflection
The two time management techniques (which are very similar) are the Pomodoro technique and time boxing. I learned a lot from the ideas of time boxing, where you work for a set period of time and then review your progress after that time ends, as opposed to just working incessantly. Currently, my usual time strategy is to give myself more time to complete my task than I think is necessary and then working straight through to completion. This technique works, but I feel it's not the most efficient use of my time. I am definitely going to start employing the time boxing strategy for Phase 0, because between working two jobs and taking this course I feel that setting smaller periods of time and working within those will help me to see where I'm at in terms of competency with the material, and help me to have my time more organized in general. I plan on using the Pomodoro technique at first to get a good idea on how I work with time boxing, and then adjusting the length of the intervals depending on how I feel during those time frames.

# 1.2 The Command Line Relfection
A shell is basically a processor that interprets code into commands for the hardware to perform, and Bash is a type of shell that processes information for the GNU operating system. I was successfully able to use all the commands, the most difficult part at this point is remembering all of them, but that will come with time. At this point I feel that the cd, grep, and the xargs commands will be the some of the more important commands to know.

*pwd - print working directory

*ls - list directory

*mv - move directory

*cd - change directory

*../ - move up a directory

*touch - makes a new file

*mkdir - make directory

*less - prints a file page by page

*rm - removes a file/directory

*help - prints the manual description of the command

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning Relfection
To begin in creating a new repo, the first thing you need to do is sign into Github, and then at the top right you will see a plus sign next to your username. Click the plus sign, and then click "New Repository", then fill in the name you want for your repository and any other relevant details. If you want to fork a repository, first you have to navigate to the repository you wish to fork. Then you will see the "fork" button on upper right hand side, a bit beneath your username. Click the fork button, and then choose the group or user you want to fork it to (if you only have your single group, it will default to that.) Finally to clone the repository to your computer, find the HTTPS link or the Clone link on the right hand side of the page and copy it. In your terminal navigate to your desktop, or wherever you would like the repo to clone to. From there type "git clone URL" where the URL is the link you copied earlier. Depending on how recently you signed in to GIthub it may ask for your username and password, after that the repository will be cloned onto your computer. You would want to fork a repository instead of creating a new one if you're try to build a branch off of another project that has already been started. I didn't run into too many problems setting up git and Github, the only one being opening my repositories in Sublime through the terminal.
