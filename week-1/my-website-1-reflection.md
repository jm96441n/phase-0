*Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
*To create a repository on Github you simply click the plus sign next to your username in the top right corner and click "new repository." From there you want to name your new repository, and choose a license for it. From there you want to find the link next to where it says https on the page. Copy that link and in your terminal you want to type 'git clone URL' where the URL is the address you copied. Doing this tells your computer to make a copy on your computer that is linked to the repository on Github.
