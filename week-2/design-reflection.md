![site map](/week-2/imgs/site-map.png) The 6 phases of web site design are 1) Information Gathering, 2) Planning, 3) Design, 4) Development, 5) Testing and Delivery, and 6) Maintenance. The Primary Goal of my site is to showcase myself, and my portfolio. My site will feature content about myself as a professional, and the content of previous work I have done that I wish to highlight for potential clients. The primary action I want users to take upon visiting my site is to either contact me or to see my portfolio. The main things that someone should know about design and user experience is that it is not universal, meaning that different people will have different reactions ton the experience on your site, and this aspect is what separates UX from usability. Also they should know that assesing the effectiveness of your UX can be difficult, because there are no direct methods to measure how effective your UX is. User experience design is the process of designing a website not solely for usability, but designing to make people feel comfortable or excited to navigate your site, and it is important because it can make the diffference between a potential client of customer using you for their neeeds as opposed to someone else. I found making the site map a little tedious, only because the web site at this stage in the game is very simple. I know further down the line this will be an invaluable tool to building sites.
