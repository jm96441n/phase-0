  1) What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was really interesting to use my learning of HTML into an actual site. I really enjoyed the process, and seeing the outcome of my work.
  2) How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was pretty easy to research and use new HTML5 elements. There are many great resources out there that helped to build the site.
  3) How did you do at keeping best practices?
  We did pretty well at keeping best practices. We did some formatting in HTML but not too much, mainly just using div and resizing some fonts.
  4) What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML seems like an easy to use language that you can use to build simple websites, it seems a little limited in terms of style building.
  5) What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I don't have too many tricks, many of the commands are spelled very close to what the command actually does.
