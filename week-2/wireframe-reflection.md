What is a wireframe?
A wireframe is the basic layout of how you want your website to look. Using different shapes, you design the layout of your website.
What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing is very beneficial for site organization. By designing how your website will look before you actually make it you can have a more uniform look to your website, and more easily move design elements around as you see fit before completing the final build.
Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I enjoyed wireframing my site more than I thought I would. The design aspect, along with the organization part, really appealed to me.
Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I revised it after seeing how my inital idea looked. Initially I wanted to have my navigation bar running vertical along the right hand side of the page, but in practice I didn't like the look of it so I moved it to the top beneath the header.
What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
My inital question was what program or website I would use to build my wireframe. I have some experience with Illustrator, so I used Google to find a cheap/free alternative and ended up using Affinity.
Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I really enjoyed the design aspect of this challenge. I honestly thought I would've found that part tedious, but the ordering and organzing the flow of the site I found to really enjoy.
