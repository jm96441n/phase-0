1) How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
Chrome's DevTools can help you test formatting configurations and see the result right away, allowing you to see the results of your formatting in real time.

2) How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
You can resize elements on the DOM using CSS by adjusting their height, width, or even scale them in relation the size of the page being displayed.

3) What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning?
Absolute positioning puts the element onto the page regardless of what is around it and anchors based on the previous element using a position tag, fixed positioning holds the element in place on the screen regardless of where you are on the webpage, static positioning is the elements default position on the page, and relative positioing moves the element while not affecting the other elements around it. I found absolute and static the easiest to use, while relative being the most difficult.

4) What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
The margin is the area surrounding the element that sits betwee the border and the next element on the page, padding is the space between the border and the element, whereas the border is area separating the margin and the padding.

5) What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, why?)

I really enjoyed this challenge, I feel it introduced us to a great tool that will help with the designing of websites in the future.
