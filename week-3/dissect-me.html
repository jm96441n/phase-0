      				What are the benefits of version control?
    			</p>
    		<p>
			      One of the main benefits of version control is that you can more accurately keep track of your work, and test new changes with a long history of back ups. For example, if a change to your code does not work, you can easily go back to a previous working version.

    		<p class="question">
			    How does git help you keep track of changes?
      		</p>
      		<p>
		        Git helps you to keep track of changes, by keeping a version of every commit you save. That way you can easily compare your current work to all of your past updates to your program.

                	When you are using CSS you will run into three tags that are very useful when you are positioning elements on your website and they are margin, border, and padding. At first glance they may seem very similar, but the subtle differences between them are what can separate a site that looks amazing from one that looks decent.

					This is the standard image that you will usually see when trying to research the difference between the three attributes. Looks a bit confusing right? There's a lot going on there, let's use a simpler example, and then look back at this and make some sense of it.

<!-- 
1) What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often?
We used header, aside, main, section, article, and nav. I find I continually use all of these (with the exception of main), because they are very useful when using CSS to target the area's I want to format more specifically.
2) How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
Elements are displayed on the page generally in the order they are written, with the exception that tags like 'header' are generally read first, then aside, then main and all the html that is contained within that.
3) What did you learn about Sublime in this challenege? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about some research on shortcuts that already exist?
I learned that Sublime is very customizable and very flexible in it's use. I will definitely create more handy snippets in the future, especially for the layout of blog posts and for the layout of the personal website we have been building in the solo challenges. We finished our challenge with about 30 minutes to spare, so our guide went through many different shortcuts within sublime and the terminal that will be very useful in the future.
